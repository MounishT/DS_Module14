# Ex 2B Priority Queue
## DATE: 03/03/2025
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters.
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1.
4. Print each element of the array during the loop.
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting.
6. End
  

## Program:
```

*/
#include<stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], intsize)
{
int i;
for(i=0;i<size;i++)
{
printf("%d ",array[i]);
}
printf("\n");
}
```

## Result:
Thus, the C program to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation is implemented successfully
